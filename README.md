## Usage

This gem was designed with simplicity in mind. Usually, sneaker wedbsites are flooded with ads and riddled with click-bait articles that have nothing to do with sneakers. This gem provides a simple way to view upcoming sneakers releases for 2021.

In order to get started, lauch the CLI application thorugh bin/show_snkrs. 

This will launch the "Brands Menu."
In this menu, several available brands will be listed and one must be selected to get sneaker data from that specified brand.

After selecting a brand, the "Sneakers Menu" will launch. 
This will list several(up to 20 items) sneakers relased and to be released in 20201. Once the list is printed, any item can be selected through its index number. This will dislay more detailed information about a specific sneaker.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
